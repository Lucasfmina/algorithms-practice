# Algorithms Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of algorithmic solutions that I have implemented as part of my practice on competitive programming platforms like LeetCode and Beecrowd. It serves as a personal reference and a resource for others looking to enhance their problem-solving skills in various domains such as data structures, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.

Each solution is crafted to meet the specific constraints and requirements of the problem statements provided by these platforms. The repository is organized by topics, making it easier to navigate and find relevant examples.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from the approaches, and contribute by suggesting improvements or adding new solutions.
